   <p style="margin-top:-5px;">This page discusses a few finer points that make the monitor useful. 
     <ul>
       <li> Progress of any action is reported at the top right corner.</li> 
       <li> On user action control panels are momentarily disabled to 
            avoid accidental operations that may confuse the browser.</li>
       <li><b>Job Summary</b> Table
         <ul>
           <li> sort the table rows by clicking on the column headers</li> 
           <li> use quick-search to filter out unwanted entries</li> 
           <li> double-click a gridid to find the job detail</li>
         </ul>
         Note that a long table takes a while to load and customise. Please be patient.
       </li>
       <li><b>Job detail</b> Tab, which in turn contains other tabbed views
         <ul>
           <li> only basic information about a job is shown by default. You will notice that certain tabs are inactive.
                Check 'Enable Job detail Tabs' in case you want to know more. uncheck the same to know less.</li>
           <li> by default only jobs belonging to the DN are shown, check 'Show jobs from my VO(s)' if you want to
                see jobs from your collaborators. However, note that you won't be able to see private information</li> 
           <li> checking auto-update will keep on updating information about the selected job every 10 minutes.</li> 
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Control, configuration and logging
         <ul>
           <li><b>Selection</b> panel mostly useful for the site admis; select jobs belonging to a 
               (a) queue (e.g cms, cdf), (b)local user (e.g cmsprd, babarsgm),
               (c) subject or certificate DN,
               (d) Resource Broker / WMS,
               (e) batch Worder Node,
               (f) date when certain jobs got submitted / queued<,
               (g) date when certain jobs started
           </li>
           <li><b>Diagnosis</b>, look for mis-behaving jobs in this tab, 
               (a) Load=0 - the job does not add any load to the node,
               (b) Load&lt;30 - CPU time &lt; 30% of Real time,
               (c) Load&gt;=30 - CPU time &gt;= 30% of Real Time, i.e well behaved jobs,
               (d) CPU=0 - no CPU time being consumed by the job, waiting for data? stuck for some reason?,
               (e) proxy expired - user proxy for the job expired, stage-out will eventually fail,
               (f) high mem/vmem jobs
           </li>
           <li>various logger areas. When an error occurs you will be automatically directed to the 'Error Logger'.
               In case you are curious to know the requests that are sent to the server, you may turn on the
               'Log Event' option. Turning on 'Log Debug' be best avoided.</li>
           <li>Configuration panel that contains the checkboxes mentioned above as well as logging options.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Different ways of accessing the web-based monitor (Pisa used as an example):
         <ul>
           <li>https://gridse.sns.it/jobmon/pisa/jobmon.html, the first job in the list is shown.</li>
           <li>for a single Grid jobid: https://gridse.sns.it/jobmon/pisa/jobmon.html?gridid=ACTUAL_GRID_JOBID</li>
           <li>a single job from another web page: https://gridse.sns.it/jobmon/pisa/jobinfo.html?gridid=ACTUAL_GRID_JOBID</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
